# Login Acces and register 

Made with:

- ` Javascript`
- `HTML`
- `CSS`

## The Repository

It is a small project in which an access page is made through registration and access.


It allows us in the registry to create a user with:
- `Name`
- `Email`
- `Password`

If you are already registered, it redirects us to the login with a small link.
In the login we can access using our email and password and register if we have not already done so.
